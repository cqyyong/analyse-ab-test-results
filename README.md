# Analyse AB Test Results

## Introduction
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.

## Goal
My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Scope of AB Tests
* Part I - Probability
* Part II - A/B Test
* Part III - Regression
